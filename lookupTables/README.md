File scatteringTablesGPM.nc contains the integrated radar and radiometer
scattering properties used in the GPM combined algorithm.

The properties of four types of hydrometeors, i.e. rain, snow, graupel and
hail, are included in the file. Properties are calculated assuming a
normalized gamma particle size distributions with $\mu$=2 and
$N_w$=0.08cm$^{-4}$.  The associated mean mass diameter, precipitation rate,
and precipitation water content associated with each entry are included
in the file. The rain, graupel and hail properties are calculated using
the Mie approach, while the snow properties are derived from DDA calculations.
Additional information is provided in the README.md in the lookup table
directory.
